DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY: BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\u003c/h4>\u003cp data-block-key=\"bdjef\">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. MOST CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO YOUR SATISFACTION BY CONTACTING SUPERNAL’S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT CONTACT@SUPERNAL.AERO. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE YOUR CONCERNS, WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF CLASS, COLLECTIVE, COORDINATED, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR OTHER KIND OF GROUP, MULTI-PLAINTIFF, OR JOINT ACTION ARE NOT PERMITTED. SUPERNALWILL PAY ALL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATOR, NO MATTER WHO WINS, SO LONG AS YOUR CLAIM IS NOT FRIVOLOUS OR BROUGHT IN BAD FAITH. HOWEVER, IN ARBITRATION, BOTH YOU AND SUPERNAL WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS´ FEES FROM THE OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU MIGHT BE IN COURT.\u003c/p>\u003cp data-block-key=\"bfq3l\">Arbitration Agreement:\u003c/p>\u003cp data-block-key=\"au39e\">(a) Supernal and you agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims between us arising out of or relating to this Agreement, use of the sites, or products, services, or programs you purchase, enroll in or seek product/service support for, whether you are a Visitor or Customer, via the sites or through mobile application, except any disputes or claims which under governing law are not subject to arbitration, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between us subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, any dispute you or we may have relating to copyrights or other intellectual property (as set forth in Section 5 below) shall not be governed by this agreement to arbitrate. For the avoidance of doubt, this means that any claims you or we may have relating to intellectual property rights against the other, including injunctive and other relief sought, may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. The agreement to arbitrate otherwise includes, but is not limited to:\u003c/p>\u003cp data-block-key=\"c4odl\">claims based in contract, tort, warranty, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; claims relating to your product for which you seek product or service support via the sites; claims arising out of or relating to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; claims relating to your data privacy or information security; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\u003c/p>\u003cp data-block-key=\"172a\">For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to “ Supernal,” “you,” and “us” shall include our respective parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, website of the foregoing, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services, products or information provided or made available under this or prior Agreements between us relating to or arising from any aspect of your use or access of the sites. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Supernal are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action to the maximum extent permitted by law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement or your relationship with Supernal for any reason.\u003c/p>\u003cp data-block-key=\"f056m\">(b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice’’). The Notice to Supernal should be addressed to: General Counsel, Supernal, Legal Department, 1101 16th Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. (“Notice Address’’). The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief you seek from Supernal (“Demand’’). If Supernal and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Supernal may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Supernal or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Supernal is entitled. In arbitration, and to the extent otherwise permitted by law, the parties may exchange “offers of compromise” or stipulate to judgments or awards in the same way the parties could in court, including for example, under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 998 for arbitrations taking place in California. Such offers of compromise shall have the same force and effect as they would in a court proceeding. The arbitration proceedings shall otherwise remain confidential, except for purposes of seeking court intervention (if necessary).\u003c/p>\u003cp data-block-key=\"d7050\">You may obtain more information about arbitration from \u003ca href=\"http://www.adr.org/\">www.adr.org\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp data-block-key=\"131a8\">(c) After Supernal receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The AAA Rules may change from time to time, and you should review them periodically.\u003c/p>\u003cp data-block-key=\"dgna2\">All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as the Agreement´s other terms and conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or any other term of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable. However, if putative class or representative claims are initially brought by either party in a court of law, and a motion to compel arbitration is brought by any party, then the court shall decide whether this agreement permits class proceedings. For the avoidance of doubt, the court and arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including with regard to the class and representative waiver provision. In any arbitration, the arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator shall not have the power to commit manifest errors of law or legal reasoning, and any award rendered by the arbitrator that employs a manifest error of law or legal reasoning may be vacated or corrected by a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error. Unless Supernal and you agree otherwise, the conduct of any arbitration will be governed by the substantive laws of your state, and hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing or registered address. Case management and other hearings shall be heard via telephone unless otherwise agreed to. Except as otherwise provided for herein, Supernal will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Supernal for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\u003c/p>\u003cp data-block-key=\"aqes0\">(d) Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.\u003c/p>\u003cp data-block-key=\"4kolk\">(e) YOU AND SUPERNAL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. If this specific subparagraph (e) is found to be unenforceable in its entirety, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. However, if only a portion of this subparagraph (e) is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of subparagraph (e) enforced. Any claims or causes of action seeking relief not subject to individual arbitration under applicable law shall be stayed in a court of competent jurisdiction pending completion of individual arbitration to the maximum extent permitted by law.\u003c/p>\u003cp data-block-key=\"3dkjh\">(f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Supernal makes any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) after your enrollment in a service or program or your use of the sites, you may reject any such change and require Supernal to adhere to the language in this arbitration provision as written at the time of your enrollment or purchase if a dispute between us arises, by providing Notice to Supernal at the Notice Address in subsection (b) above.\u003c/p>\u003cp data-block-key=\"459u2\">\u003c/p>\u003ch4 data-block-key=\"ec7pk\">5.

                                    Supernal may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount

                                    arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or

                                    Such offers of compromise shall have the same force and effect as they would in a

                                    online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The AAA Rules may
                                    change from time to time, and you should review them periodically.</p>
                                <p data-block-key="dgna2">All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the
                                    scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as the Agreement´s
                                    other terms and conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to
                                    resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this
                                    arbitration provision or any other term of this Agreement including, but not limited
                                    to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void
                                    or voidable. However, if putative class or representative claims are initially
                                    brought by either party in a court of law, and a motion to compel arbitration is
                                    brought by any party, then the court shall decide whether this agreement permits
                                    class proceedings. For the avoidance of doubt, the court and arbitrator shall be
                                    bound by the terms of this Agreement, including with regard to the class and
                                    representative waiver provision. In any arbitration, the arbitrator shall be bound
                                    by the terms of this Agreement and shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator
                                    shall not have the power to commit manifest errors of law or legal reasoning, and
                                    any award rendered by the arbitrator that employs a manifest error of law or legal
                                    reasoning may be vacated or corrected by a court of competent jurisdiction for any
                                    such error. Unless Supernal and you agree otherwise, the conduct of any arbitration
                                    will be governed by the substantive laws of your state, and hearings will take place
                                    in the county (or parish) of your billing or registered address. Case management and
                                    other hearings shall be heard via telephone unless otherwise agreed to. Except as
                                    otherwise provided for herein, Supernal will pay all AAA filing, administration and
                                    arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice
                                    requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of
                                    your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an
                                    improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
                                    Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA
                                    Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Supernal for all monies previously
                                    disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.</p>
